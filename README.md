# Personal Landing Page & Blog

This repository contains the source for my personal website and blog, deployed via GitHub Pages. It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and Tailwind CSS. The site began as a simple starter, so if you're looking for a starting point feel free to fork the repo and make it your own.

## Features

- **Astro** for fast static site generation
- **Tailwind CSS** styled with the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) palette
- Preconfigured components, layouts and pages
- Ready to be forked and modified to fit your style

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** this repository if you'd like to use it as a starting point.
2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start developing**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Customize** the content in `src/pages` and `src/components`.
